            Mesa Verde National Park is located in southwestern Colorado. The name,
            Mesa Verde, is Spanish for “green table.” The park is best known for its
            archeological sites, which contain over 600 cliff dwellings. A park
            regulation requires that a Park Ranger accompany all visitors who wish to
            enter one of the dwellings

            Congress passed the Preservation of American Antiquities Act in 1906,
            which made it a Federal crime to collect or destroy any historic or
            prehistoric object or building on federally owned land. Then President
            Theodore Roosevelt signed a Congressional bill to make Mesa Verde a
            national park in June 1906
