            The Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park contains 2,000 foot
            narrow canyon walls, which drop almost vertically to the Gunnison River.
            Two campgrounds are located in the park – one on the south rim and one
            on the north rim. The visitor’s center is located on South Rim Drive and
            provides a video theater with two orientation programs.

        <p>
            Located in the southwest section of Colorado, some of the park’s more
            popular recreational activities are camping, backpacking, bird and wildlife
            viewing, fishing, and rafting. In the winter months, visitors enjoy crosscountry 
            skiing and snowshoeing. The park is open year round, but access to the south rim 
            is limited in the winter.

            Birds and animals add color and interest to the landscape. The park contains 65
            species of mammals, 260 species of birds, and 900 species of plants. Black bears,
            mountain lions, and bobcats live in the park, but seldom are seen. Moose and
            mule deer are more visible. In autumn, herds of American elk roam the park and
            frequently are visible, even at the lower elevations.

        <h1>Great Sand Dunes National Park Preserve</h1>
        <!--Part 1-->
        <p>
            One of the nation’s newest national parks, Great Sand Dunes was upgraded from
            a national monument and preserve in the year 2000. Located at the foot of the
            Sangre de Cristo mountain range, the dunes appear to stretch to infinity. The
            dunes cover approximately 39 square miles and are the tallest in
            North America – over 750 feet. The park is open all year, 24 hours a
            day.
