    <p>Colorado offers unequaled natural mountain scenery, abundant wildlife, and more outdoor activities than you can
        imagine. The name Colorado comes from the Spanish word “colorado” which means “reddish color.” On August 1, 1876, President Ulysses Grant
        proclaimed Colorado the 38th state.</p>
    
    <p>Colorado’s spectacular scenery extends from the Rocky Mountains National Park to the
        Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument. Visitors flock to Colorado to enjoy the state’s four national parks, five national
        monuments, and over forty state parks.</p>
