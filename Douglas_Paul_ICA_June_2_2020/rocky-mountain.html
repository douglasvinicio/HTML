            Rocky Mountain National Park is more than 415 square miles and has 114 named
            peaks over 10,000 feet. One of the more popular hiking trails is the Keyhole
            Route on Longs’ Peak. At 14,255 feet, Longs’ Peak is the highest peak in the
            Rocky Mountain National Park and the fifteenth tallest in Colorado.

            The park contains three distinct ecosystems which correspond to elevation: the
            montane, which is 7,000 to 9,000 feet above sea level; the subalpine ecosystem
            which is 9,000 to 11,500 feet and spans the tree line; and the alpine tundra, at the
            top, which is over 11,500 feet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Birds and animals add color and interest to the landscape. The park contains 65
            species of mammals, 260 species of birds, and 900 species of plants. Black bears,
            mountain lions, and bobcats live in the park, but seldom are seen. Moose and
            mule deer are more visible. In autumn, herds of American elk roam the park and
            frequently are visible, even at the lower elevations.
